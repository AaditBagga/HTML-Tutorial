Both Chrome and Safari (as well as most modern web browsers)
use a combination of interpretation and compilation to handle JavaScript.
   The combination of interpretation and compilation is often referred to as 
"interpretation with a JIT compiler." This approach allows browsers 
to strike a balance between fast startup times (from interpretation) 
and optimized execution speeds (from compilation).
   Both Chrome and Safari use their own JavaScript engines. Chrome uses the V8 JavaScript engine,
while Safari uses the JavaScriptCore engine (also known as Nitro). 
These engines incorporate advanced techniques for optimizing JavaScript code execution, 
making web applications run faster and more efficiently.
